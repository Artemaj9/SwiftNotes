#Extensions
##Extending existing data structeres

#### You can add methods/propertise to a class/struct/enum (even if you don't have the source).

## There are some restrictions 

#### You can't re-implement methods or properties that are already there (only add new ones).
#### The properties you add can have no storage associated with them (computed only).
